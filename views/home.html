							About Me
						</h1>
						<div class='body'>
							Lifetime Memories began out of my passion for photography.&nbsp;&nbsp;My mission is to bring your images to life and preserve Lifetime Memories through creative and unique designs with quality and integrity at reasonable rates, while maintaining a high, moral work ethic based on Christian values.
							<br /><br />
							I reside in McKinney, TX with my husband who is the inspiration for a lot of my work.&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated from Dallas Baptist University with an MBA in Marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I shoot exclusively in digital and am aslo proficient in Adobe Photoshop.&nbsp;&nbsp;I serve clients in the DFW area, but also love traveling so please don't hesitate to ask me about destination details.
							<br /><br />
							I absolutely enjoy what I do, and I do it with lots of creativity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Your life's captured moments are sure to create memories that will last a lifetime.
